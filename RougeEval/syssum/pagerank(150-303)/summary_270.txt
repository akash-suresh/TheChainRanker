The bill proposes $5.2 billion in new spending over five years, and most of that will increase benefits currently received by welfare recipients.
So the House's liberal majority hoped to achieve an increase in welfare outlays by making a bow to "reform." 
The House Democrats' claim that welfare recipients are worse off than they were in 1970 -- in terms of the level of benefits received -- is dubious.
It is difficult to accept that the $4.3 billion increase in basic benefits proposed in the Family Welfare Reform Act will do much of anything about the problem of hard-core welfare dependency.
