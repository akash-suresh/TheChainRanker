Bank of Boston announced Monday that it was writing off $200 million of loans to less-developed countries and that it was placing all but a small portion of its loans to the Third World on a non-accrual basis.
Bank of Boston also placed on non-accrual $470 million in loans to less-developed countries that are unrelated to trade.
