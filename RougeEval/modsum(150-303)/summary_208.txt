Firefighters got the upper hand Friday on an 8,200-acre brush fire in Cleveland National Forest, California that destroyed 11 structures near Lake Elsinore. Meanwhile, a brush fire that burned more than 2,000 acres of mostly rugged terrain in the Antelope Valley this week was contained by firefighters Friday. Authorities estimated that fighting the fire near Lake Elsinore will wind up costing $1.5 million. Investigators said the fire appears to have been caused by people near a roadside store. They appealed to the public for help in identifying those responsible. Residents evacuated from 200 homes near Lake Elsinore on Wednesday have returned to their homes.
