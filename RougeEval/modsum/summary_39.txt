Pan American Flight 103 crashed in Lockerbie, Scotland last Wednesday night and all 259 aboard and 22 people on the ground were killed. The plane evidently exploded in the air. The flight was out of Heathrow in London and at a normal cruising altitude of 31,000 feet. Authorities believe the cause is sabotage. A bomb threat had been made against Pan Am jetliners, and the State Department had passed the information along to Pan Am. A radical Palestinian group is believed responsible.
